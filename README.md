# markdown-engine
## what the program does

This application takes in Markdown and outputs HTML, LaTeX, or any other standard document format based on the input.

## My approach 
 
1. Use a React Library to parse the Markdown and output the HTML.
2. Use useffect hook to update state as soon as the input changes.

- node(12.13.0 or later)
- npm
- editor: Visual Studio Code(recommended)
